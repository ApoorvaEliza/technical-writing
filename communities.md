# Technical writing communities

There are various communities dedicated to technical writing. Joining these is a great way to get to know other technical writers, learn from experienced technical writers, and find or advertise jobs. They might also host conferences, workshops, or other events.

## Write the Docs
This is the largest community of technical writers. You can find out more about them on [their website](https://www.writethedocs.org/) or join [their Slack group](https://www.writethedocs.org/slack/) directly.
